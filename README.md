# Arduino controlled UV-C Steriliser

A component of the RonaCop project: A UVC sterilizer box used for sterilizing masks and everyday objects.

This is part of the RonaCop project that aims to reduce the spread of the Corona virus within households by using technology.

## The science behind UV sterilisation
UV-C radiation (wavelengths between 200 and 280 nm), is not present in normal sunlight experienced on earth (like UVA and UVB) as wavelengths lower than ~300 nm are absorbed by the ozone layer.

Exposure to UV-C light has been proven to kill virusses when applied in specific dosages. It has been found that energies of between 7 J/m2 and 241 J/m2 kill different types of coronavisuees [1, 2] The energy that reaces the material from a UV-C lamp is determined by the radiation level of the lamp,the distance of the lamp to the object being sterilised as well as the exposure time. And can be calculated as follows:


## WARNING: UV-C light is dangerous as it can modify DNA, cause burns and cause damage to the eyes. NEVER LOOK INTO A UV-C LIGHT WHEN IT IS ON and NEVER expose any part of your body to it.
